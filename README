 How time Flies . I'm one of the student of Benilde now. This is my dream. I'm considering one of Benildean at the same time La sallian. As a college student,my role is, first of all I need to study hard, I need to manage my time to meet my deadline, more so ,to concentrate my study than to play DOTA. I have to show that my vision will be accomplish as promised to my self and to my parent. My ultimate goal is to become a well known game designer.  
<p style="font-size:25; color:lightblue">New routines</B></BR><Br>

  My routine in college life is to study hard as a Game Designer And Developer. I need to spend much time to master this, because my teacher said that this course is very  stessful and it will requires alot of time in order to master it.So many changes happens for now on .It's quite different when I was in High School compare to college I always spend my time in computer shop every after school and besides my parent spent alot of money in tuition fee . My new routine is to go straight home and finish my assignments . I have to prove to my parent whatever they will spend will compensate.

<p style="font-size:25 ; color: lightblue">

Like our Csb teacher told us, me and my classmates will be the one seeing each other more often even  after our graduation because we are the only people that studied BS-IT major in GDD,I think for now on we need to become closer to each other so that someday if we are   on the same  company we have the chemistry to develop game or to design a game . It's quite a challenge to everyone.


<p style=" font-size: 25;color:lightblue">New assumptions</p>
<p style="font-size: 25; color:lightblue">

My new assumption as a Benildean I will do my work ExtraOrdinary well, exert more effort to show my skill to shine my talents, to do what was promised to my self and to my parent. To be a good example to the new generation of today.
